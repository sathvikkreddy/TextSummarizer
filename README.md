# TextSummarizer
The size of data on the Internet has risen in an exponential manner over the past decade. Thus, the need for a solution emerges, that transforms this vast raw information into useful information which a human brain can understand. One such common technique in research that helps in dealing with enormous data is text summarization. Automatic text summarization essentially condenses a long document into a shorter format while preserving its information content and overall meaning. It is a potential solution to the information overload. Several automatic summarizers exist in the literature capable of producing high-quality summaries, but they do not focus on preserving the underlying meaning and semantics of the text. TextSummarizer capture and preserve the semantics of text as the fundamental feature for producing high-quality summaries.
